-- Calling conversation scenario
Hi, This is Atsushi Furukawa calling, and I am a senior programmer at IJ Solutions.
I've met you at js.dev Yokohama last week.
 
 >> Yes, I remember.
 
 Well, I was calling today because I'll go to Yokohama next week.
 And I am hoping that we can make a casual meeting then.
 
 >> Sure.  We can meet at drop cafe.
    (wait 3 seconds)   

Sure. Thank you. 

>> You are welcome.

OK. I'll see you next Friday at drop cafe.
Good bye.
