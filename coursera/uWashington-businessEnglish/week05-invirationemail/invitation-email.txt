Hello, Filson.

I wanted to go to Maker Fair 2022 Yokohama, because of I got two tickets for them.
It's pretty interesting that show new goods and gadget made by the garage.

I was thinking it can get new idea for outdoor cafe goods. 

The fair will open at 10:00, Next Friday, at Yokohama Silk Center.

We would meet Silk Cafe at 11:30 then, go to the fair.

Let me know if you can make it. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best.

Atsushi
