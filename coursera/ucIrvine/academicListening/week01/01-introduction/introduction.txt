introduction

Hi. My name is Atsushi Furukawa, and my native language is Japanese.
I want to work as a programmer soon, for world wide.
It's necessary English for work on taking notes and listening it.
Japanese and English are different, for example, the Japanese verb are last of the sentence.
I study this course to write English well.
