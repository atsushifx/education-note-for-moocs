First of all, I disagree that Anyone who speaks the language can teach the language.

I think the most important thing is everyone talk the language, but not teach the language.
So I think teaching language needs the language teacher.
This means that you can't teach some important difference of your language nuance, 

For example, about me, I'm from Japan, so I teach Japanese. I also teach Japanese onomatopoeia.
The onomatopoeia is a sound of seen on your front. When we see the snow weather, Japanese says "sensing" the snow is dropping.
Or weather is good, Japanese also say "" that sunlight is warm.

It's very difficult to teach other language user. I think teaching language needs language teacher.
