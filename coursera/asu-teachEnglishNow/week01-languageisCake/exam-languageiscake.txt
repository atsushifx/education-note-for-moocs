My opinion of "Language is cake"

Atsushi Furukawa

Hi, my name is Atsushi Furukawa, and I'm from Japan.
Now, I write about language is cake.

The cake is delicious, sweet, and feel happy by eating. 
Language is same. We use language in conversation. 
We feel happy to talk about fun things, for example friends, hobby, etc.
Covers fun makes from language, it it like cake decorations.

Therefore. It's important, what we talk about. We teach language not only grammar and  words
but also our culture, like foods, sports, songs, etc.
I like Japanese subculture animes and games, so I often talk about them.

If you have an interest in Japanese games, let's talk about this.

Yes. Why I take this course? It's talk about these talks worldwide.
But I have second reason, I worked as programmer ago, but now I retire by ASD.
In this case I can work remotely and part time.
These jobs harder look in Japan, I search part time jobs in English.
So, I can talk business English clearly.

Thanks for reading.
