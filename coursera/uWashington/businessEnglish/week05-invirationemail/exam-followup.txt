Dear Richard,

I don't know you remember me. We met last week at the Maker Fair Yokohama.
We got great conversation time about home maid robot arm kit for challenged people.

Anyway, I wanted to get time about this challenge to talk with you.
I have scheduled  go to Seattle next month, and I wonder we get a meeting together near your office if you will get time for me.


Please let me know if you have some time next month and are interested in meeting.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Atsushi Furukawa, agla.com Engineering Manager.
