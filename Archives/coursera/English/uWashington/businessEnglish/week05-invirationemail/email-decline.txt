Hello, Atsushi.

Thank you for your invitation. 
It's nice to talk about your story, but I apologized you until I can't go with you because
I already scheduled at.

I will let meet you with lunch next Tuesday, if you can schedule there.

Sorry again for not being able to make it, but I hope we can get together soon.

Best,

Filson
