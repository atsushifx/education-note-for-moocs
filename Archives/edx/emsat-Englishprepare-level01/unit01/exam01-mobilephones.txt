I think it has two reasons, mobility and gamification.
The mobility means you can study everywhere, every time.
For example, you will go to school or office, on the train, you can study  it.

The gamification cause your studio makes fun.
Studding application on  like playing quiz games.
Your answer of English words, pronunciation is correct, you can get points.
But your answer is in collecting, your life gets decreased.
That's a gamification.

Thus, you can study everywhere and fun. It's an answer.
